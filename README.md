# Champak Study Hub PWA

Installable, local-first studying hub for `search.learnwithchampak.live`. It preserves Champak Search while tracking searches, opened resources, learning status, saved resources, notes and recent activity in the browser.

## Deploy

Upload every file and folder in this directory to the root of the hosting repository. Keep `CNAME` in the root. GitHub Pages will serve the site over HTTPS, which is required for PWA installation and service workers.

## PWA files

- `manifest.webmanifest` — app name, colors, icons and shortcuts
- `sw.js` — app-shell and search-data caching
- `offline.html` — offline fallback page
- `icons/` — standard, maskable and Apple touch icons
- `OneSignalSDKWorker.js` — OneSignal-compatible root service worker
- `sw.js` — combined notification and PWA caching logic
- `NOTIFICATIONS.md` — dashboard setup, broadcasts and testing

When `sw.js` changes, increment `CACHE_VERSION` so visitors receive the new cached files.
